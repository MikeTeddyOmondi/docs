# Learning Rust

## Intro:

Rust is a systems programming language that allows for building applications that are performant and efficient during runtime. Rust programs are memory safe and their performance metrics are close to that of C language.

## Installation:

1. Windows: `choco install rustc`

2. Linux:`curl ...`  

> ðŸ“ŒBe sure to check the Rust docs [here](https://rust-lang.org/docs)  

### Creating a New Project:

```shell
cargo new <PROJECT_NAME>
```

#### Importance of ownership in Rust

Ownership prrevents memory safety issues:

1. Dangling pointers

2. Double-free - trying to free memory that has already been freed

3. Memory leaks - not freeing memory that should have been freed
